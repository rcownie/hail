Hail Tutorials
==============

To take Hail for a test drive, go through our tutorials. These can be viewed here in the documentation,
but we recommend instead that you run them yourself with Jupyter.


Hail Overview
=============

This notebook is designed to provide a broad overview of Hailâ€™s functionality, with emphasis on the
functionality to manipulate and query a genetic dataset. We walk through a genome-wide SNP association
test, and demonstrate the need to control for confounding caused by population stratification.

Types
=====

This notebook is a hands-on introduction to Hail's type system.

Expressions
===========

This notebook is a hands-on introduction to manipulating and understanding the
:class:`.Expression` interface in Hail.

Matrix Tables
=============

This notebook communicates some understanding of the :class:`.MatrixTable`
data representation used in the GWAS tutorial, and some of the operations
that are possible (and easy!) in this interface.

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 2

    9: MatrixTable<tutorials/09-matrixtable.ipynb>


Plot Examples
=============

This notebook contains examples of how to use the plotting functions in Hail's
:mod:`.plot` module.
