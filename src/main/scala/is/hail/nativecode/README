This directory has code for managing "off-heap" data shared
with C++, generating C++ source code and compiling it into
dynamic-loaded libraries, managing those shared libraries,
and calling the dynamic-loaded functions.

Corresponding C++ implementations of native methods are in
the directory hail/src/main/c, and are built into libhail.so

The generated C++ code can use at least C++11 language and standard-library
features (in the future probably C++17), and also can include files 
from src/main/resources/include.

Most features used in generated code will be accessible through
a top-level header file #include "hail/hail.h"
