hail/src/main/scala/nativecode/README

This directory has code for managing "off-heap" data shared
with C++, generating C++ source code and compiling it into
dynamic-loaded libraries, managing those shared libraries,
and calling the dynamic-loaded functions.

Corresponding C++ implementations of native methods are in
the directory hail/src/main/c, and are built into libhail.so

The generated C++ code can use C++17 language and standard-library
features, and also can include files from ${HAIL_HOME}/include.
Most features used in generated code will be accessible through
a top-level header file #include "hail/hail.h"
