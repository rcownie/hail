Hail dynamically-generated C++ code needs to #include various header
files declaring Hail-specific classes and functions.  To allow this the
relevant header files must be part of the Hail release, and must be
accessible in a known directory.

The initial design is that the header files are under ${HAIL_HOME}/include,
and the build of dynamic-generated code will automatically get the value
of ${HAIL_HOME}, and provide it as -I${HAIL_HOME}/include in the
dynamic-build process.

The code under src/main/c will also refer to the same copy of the header
files, to guarantee consistency.

To avoid possible collisions with non-hail header files, we put everything
in the include/hail directory and do #include "hail/SomeHeaderFile.h".

When/if we need to make third-party (but open-source) libraries usable
from dynamically-generated code, their header directories can also go in this
include/ directory, as siblings of include/hail.  But note that such library
code must also be accessible on all nodes of the cluster, possibly by linking
into libhail.so.
